          A secondary panel renders all the messages flowing through the topic in real time, with supplementary insight into the latest message. 
          Selecting a specific partition further filters down the stream of messages. Additional partition metadata is displayed on a third panel.

          Broker tiles provide the user with real time metrics such as which topics the broker is storing, partition leadership, 
          message rates per second, and broker failure alerts.

          Clicking on a tile will open up a sidebar display of historical graph data of the selected broker message rates by topic.
